"""
Project Solar! This is a basic data analyst script meant to allow the user to gather information on NS regions' WA -
membership rates as well as who is endorsing who etc.

Patch Notes vM0.2.4: Redid most of it for interaction with the GUI. . . needs work
Patch Notes vM0.2.3: Added Try/Except to check if there are no WA nations
Patch Notes vM0.2.2: Merged Malphe fork, did input validation for region/nation that are not valid
Patch Notes vM0.2: Rewrote entire thing to make use of functions to allow different options for the user -M
Patch Notes vA0.1.2: Added functionality to show non-endorsers for officers

Malphe Fork 1D.5M.2023Y: tweaked command line interface. Added functionality for non-endorsers with [nation] tags.
